      Complete each challenge listed below by editing the code inside the JS
      section of this Codepen. Place your code in the areas indicated by the
      comments.
    </p>
    <p>
      Use the developer console or the Codepen console (with the Console button
      provided by Codepen at the bottom left of your screen) to see console.log
      messages. Be aware that the Codepen console does not show all error
      messages, so if you're running into an error, try opening your browser's
      built-in developer console.
    </p>

    <h3>Challenge 1</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Use the <strong>map</strong> method on the numbers array given at line 2
        to add 5 to each number and put the results into a new array. The code
        has been started for you at line 3.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Challenge 2</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Use the map method on the same numbers array to turn it into an array of
        strings, and add a colon and a space after each number. The code has
        been started for you at line 7.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Challenge 3</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Use the map method on the words array on line 11 to remove the "s" from
        the end of each word. The code has been started for you in line 12.
        <strong>Hint:</strong> Research the use of the String.slice() method to
        remove the final letter from a string. There are other String methods
        that could also be used.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Challenge 4</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Use the map method on the words array from line 11 to return an array
        with just the first letter of each word.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Bonus Challenge</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Use the map method on the words array to return an array with just the
        first letter of each word capitalized (along with the rest of the word
        in lower case)
      </li>
    </ul>
