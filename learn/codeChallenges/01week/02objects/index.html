      Complete each challenge listed below by editing the code inside the JS
      section of this Codepen. Place your code in the areas indicated by the
      comments.
    </p>
    <p>
      Use the developer console or the Codepen console (with the Console button
      provided by Codepen at the bottom left of your screen) to see console.log
      messages. Be aware that the Codepen console does not show all error
      messages, so if you're running into an error, try opening your browser's
      built-in developer console.

    <h3>Code Challenge</h3>
    <p>
      Described below are 4 items. Turn each of them into an object. The first
      one has been completed for you as an example. Each object has at least one
      property and a method. A method call is already written for you as a test
      for each object. For the fifth item, you will create your own object.
    </p>
    <ol>
      <li>
        A <strong>rabbit</strong> with the property <strong>"color"</strong> set
        to the value of <strong>"white"</strong>. A
        <strong>checkWatch()</strong> method will result in a console.log that
        says "A white rabbit checks his watch and exclaims 'I'm late!'" -- the
        color "white" in this message should be referenced dynamically from the
        property.
      </li>
      <li>
        A <strong>spaceship</strong> with the property <strong>"name"</strong>.
        Name the spaceship whatever you wish. A <strong>launch()</strong> method
        will result in a JavaScript <strong>alert</strong> that says, "You have
        launched the spaceship (your spaceship name here, referencing the name
        property)!";
      </li>
      <li>
        A shopping <strong>cart</strong> with a property
        <strong>"contents"</strong> initialized to an
        <strong>empty array</strong>. A method
        <strong>addItem(item)</strong> will add an item to the contents array.
      </li>
      <li>
        A <strong>lever</strong> with the property <strong>"stamp"</strong> set
        to the string <strong>"ACME"</strong>. Write a
        <strong>pull()</strong> method for it and console.log: "An anvil stamped
        (reference the stamp property here dynamically) drops on your head."
      </li>
      <li>
        Create your own object and give it
        <strong>at least one property</strong> and
        <strong>at least one method</strong>. Then call one of the methods you
        created. Use your imagination! <strong>Bonus challenge:</strong> Give
        one of the methods at least one parameter, and use the argument passed
        into that parameter within the method body.
      </li>
    </ol>

    <h4>Bonus Challenge:</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Add to the shopping cart item a <strong>removeItem(item)</strong> method
        that takes a string as its argument, then checks for if a string
        matching that argument exists in the contents array. If so, it should
        remove it and console.log a success message and the new value of the
        contents array. If not, it should console.log an error message saying
        that the item is not in the cart. Test the method by calling it like
        this: <strong>cart.removeItem("laptop");</strong>
      </li>
    </ul>
